# libft
The first project we are expected to complete as 42 cadets.  
We recode core libc functions like strlen, bzero, strcpy, etc.  
Additionally, we code new functions, such as ft_memalloc which allocates and initializes a chunk of memory, or ft_strsplit, which both trims and explodes strings based on whatever character has been entered as a delimiter.  As we continue through the cursus, we can add more functions to the library, such as get_next_line.

# Compiling
Run make.  Include the libft.a in any program you compile with a -L flag.  Enjoy!
